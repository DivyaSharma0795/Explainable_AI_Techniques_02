# Explainable Techniques II
Assignment Instructions:

PART 1
For a model and dataset of your choice, produce PDP, ICE, and ALE plots. Exploratory analysis of your dataset should be performed to determine the amount of correlation between features.  

Provide a comprehensive explanation of your plots. Discuss any interesting findings that are shown in the plots. Discuss any differences you see in the PDP and ALE plots. Discuss your exploratory findings around correlation between features and the impact this has (if any) on your results.


PART 2
For our next class, you will need to be familiar with some fundamental deep learning concepts. For some of you, this will be a quick review. For others, this may require a deeper dive. Review the videos and individually answer the quiz questions available in Canvas

Submission

PART 1
Submit a link to a GitHub repository with a Google Colab notebook for your assignment. Ensure your Google Colab notebook has the necessary documentation to run it. (See example in class repository). 
Ensure that you are following best practices for your GitHub repository and using branches/PRs appropriately. It is your job to ensure that your repository is kept up to date with necessary requirements and documentation for running code. 

PART 2

The Review Quiz is available in Canvas. This should be completed individually and after watching the Review videos (if necessary). You have unlimited attempts so if you need further review you can rewatch videos and retake the quiz. I encourage you to spend effort reviewing concepts, as it will make next week (and subsequent weeks) much easier.
